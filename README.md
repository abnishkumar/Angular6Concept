# 1.ng add
New command ng add that will add a new capability to your project. It was using your package manager to download new dependencies and invoke an installation script which can update your project with configuration changes, add additional dependencies, or scaffold package-specific initialization code. That is very powerful because we all know how hard to manage dependencies in large projects, especially with significant updates.
# 2.ng update
We have now a command to update the Angular dependencies of our CLI applications automatically. All your @angular/* dependencies will be updated to the latest stable version which includes all the core packages in your dependencies and devDependencies like rxjs, zone, typescript etc.., and also the CLI itself.
# 2.angular-cli.json now renamed to angular.json
